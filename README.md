PostOps backend, implemented in Laravel

Clone or UnZip

Changelog:

Version 0.1.1

Almost fully implemented, undoubtedly with issues:

Register / Login, JWT tokens working
sets initial strings, saves and reloads strings from MySQL database.
works with React front end on Git, with the change of local port from 6026 (go), to 8000

Does *not* implement the Proxy mode.

Probably will get rewrit from a new Laravel project, as a part of a simple Laravel / ReST / JWT tutorial.
